**Abstract**: XXX


## Data Sources:

We obtained data on **EVALI cases** in 2019 at the state-level from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Available here: <http://dx.doi.org/10.15585/mmwr.mm6839e1>

We obtained data on **prevalence of current e-cigarette users** from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS), the most up-to-date data are from 2017. This is available here: <https://nccd.cdc.gov/BRFSSPrevalence/rdPage.aspx?rdReport=DPH_BRFSS.ExploreByTopic&irbLocationType=StatesAndMMSA&islClass=CLASS19&islTopic=TOPIC67&islYear=2017&islLocation=>

We obtain data on **state population in 2017** from the National Cancer Instituteâ€™s Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Program. Available here: https://seer.cancer.gov/popdata/

Data on **recreational and medicial marijuana status** come from Hollingsworth, Alex and Wing, Coady and Bradford, Ashley, Comparative Effects of Recreational and Medical Marijuana Laws On Drug Use Among Adult and Adolescents (September 27, 2019). Available at SSRN: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3400519 or <http://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.3400519>


## Software Used:
All analysis were done on unix machines using R 3.6.1. We use a number of user-written packages (`plyr`, `cowplot`, `tidyverse`, `estimatr`, `tidylog`, `huxtable`, `flextable`, `ggrepel`, `mfx`, and `openxlsx`). We use `pacman` to load and install each of these. 

                that should be outlined in the master.do file. We also use a number of shell commands from within stata (whenever the ! command is present). Most of these should still work on a non-unix system, but may need to be modified.
