Hi Alex,

Here is a revised draft in fairly rough form. Also attached is the start of a point by point reply to the reviewers. 

A few things:

(1) I made it longer by adding a methods section. It seems like this is what they want but I'm not sure about the word count.,

(2) In the text, I think they would be happier if we reported the coefficient and then put the SE, CI, and P value in parenthesis. Crazy but whatever. I didn't quite do that because in a few places I was not sure how and also I didn't have the actual output handy.

(3) I think I sorted out the e-cig stuff. But you should check.

Anyway: give it a read and see what you think. I believe we are fairly close.
